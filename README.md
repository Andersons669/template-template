  - Customer Account Management
  - Transaction Processing System
  - Loan Management System
  - Financial Reporting
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Frontend: ReactJS or Angular
  - Backend: Node.js, Express
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
  - Hosting: AWS or Azure

### **7. User Roles and Permissions**
| **Role**         | **Description**                                                            | **Permissions**                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Administrator** | Manages all system features, including user roles and configurations.     | Full access to all features.                    |
| **Customer**      | Regular users who manage their accounts and transactions.                 | View and manage their own accounts and loans.   |
| **Teller**        | Bank staff who assist with transactions and account management.           | Limited access to transactions and accounts.    |

### **8. System Architecture**
- **Technical Components**:
  - **Frontend**: ReactJS for an interactive UI.
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express for RESTful APIs.
  - **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
- **System Diagram**: *(Include a diagram showing how components interact)*
- **Architecture Type**: Microservices architecture for scalability.


**9. Database Design**
- **ER Diagram**: *(Include a diagram of the database structure)*
- **Key Tables**:
  1. **Customers**:
     - `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`
  2. **Accounts**:
     - `account_id`, `customer_id`, `account_type`, `balance`
  3. **Transactions**:
     - `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `amount`, `type`, `date`
  4. **Loans**:
     - `loan_id`, `customer_id`, `principal`, `interest_rate`, `status`


### **10. User Interface (UI) Design**
- **Homepage**:
  - Overview of account balances, transactions, and loans.
- **Account Page**:
  - View and manage customer account details.
- **Transaction Page**:
  - List of all transactions with filtering and search options.
- **Loan Page**:
  - Loan application form and repayment management.
- **Mockups**: *(Add Figma or Adobe XD mockups if available)*

---

### **11. Security and Compliance Measures**
- **Authentication**:
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Data Security**:
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.
  - API communication secured with HTTPS.
- **Compliance**:
  - GDPR for customer data.
  - PCI DSS for payment information.

---

### **12. API Design and Endpoints**
- **Key Endpoints**:
  1. `POST /api/accounts`: Create a new account.
  2. `GET /api/accounts/{id}`: Retrieve account details.
  3. `POST /API/transactions`: Record a new transaction.
  4. `GET /API/transactions`: Retrieve all transactions.
  5. `POST /API/loans`: Apply for a loan.
  6. `GET /api/loans/{id}`: Check loan status.
- **Sample API Request**:
  ```json
  POST /API/accounts
  {
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "account_type": "Savings",
    "initial_deposit": 1000
  }
  ```

### **13. Testing and Quality Assurance**
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Test individual APIs and database queries.
- **Integration Testing**:
  - Verify interactions between frontend, backend, and database.
- **Performance Testing**:
  - Load-test the transaction system for high-volume operations.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
  - Ensure features meet user expectations.

---

### **14. Deployment and Maintenance**
- **Hosting**:
  - AWS EC2 for backend services.
  - AWS S3 for static assets.
- **Deployment**:
  - Use CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Use tools like Datadog or New Relic for performance monitoring.
- **Backup and Recovery**:
  - Daily backups of the database.
  - Automated recovery scripts for disaster scenarios.


SummaThe system design ensures scalability, security, and user-friendliness. It provides essential banking services in compliance with industry standards.
